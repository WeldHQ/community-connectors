Integrations to SaaS applications via Weld's Custom Connector.

With the Custom Connector from Weld you can write an integration in 1 file. Connect to the data, get it out of the API and Weld will take care of scheduling, error handling, schemas, loading to the data warehouse and alerting.

We hope these connectors will be useful as is or as examples for new connectors.

We can't wait to see what you'll build!
